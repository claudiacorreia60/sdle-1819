# Decentralized Timeline Service

Decentralized timeline service (e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) that harvests peer-to-peer and edge devices. Users have an identity and publish small text messages in their local machine, forming a local timeline. They can subscribe to other users timelines and will help to store and forward their content. Remote content is available when a source or source subscriber is online and can forward the information. Information from subscribed sources can be ephemeral and only stored and forwarded for a given time period.
